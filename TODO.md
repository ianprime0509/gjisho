# TODO

- Add example details view: when an example is clicked on, bring up a panel with
  more details, including links to relevant dictionary entries. Furigana would
  be great.
- Tweak search query behavior (this is an ongoing effort). Right now, only
  prefix searches are supported; this may take some thought to integrate with
  FTS5 unless we want to come up with some other search backend.
- Kanji stroke order diagrams
- Kanji radical search using https://www.edrdg.org/krad/kradinf.html
